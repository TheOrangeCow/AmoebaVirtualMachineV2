### How it works?
It takes 8 bit binary code (00001111) and runs them.
The first 4 bits are the Operation Code and the other 4 bits are a number for a address location or a number

### Operation Code Set
This is the operation codes also find a pdf version <a href ="/TheAmoebaV2OperationCodeSet.pdf">Here</a>

| Opcode | Instruction | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0000 | LDA | Load the Accumulator with the contents of the addressed location. |
| 0001 | STA | Store the contents of the Accumulator in the addressed location. |
| 0010 | LDAN | Load the Accumulator with the actual value of the address. |
| 0011 | ADD | Add the contents of the addressed location to the value in the Accumulator. The result is stored in the Accumulator. |
| 0100 | SUB | Subtract the contents of the addressed location from the value in the Accumulator. The result is stored in the Accumulator. |
| 0101 | MLT | Multiply the contents of the addressed location by the value in the Accumulator. The result is stored in the Accumulator. |
| 0110 | DIV | Divide the value in the Accumulator by the contents of the addressed location. The result is stored in the Accumulator (no remainder). |
| 0111 | JF | Jump forward a number of instructions. The number is given by the contents of the addressed location. |
| 1000 | JB | Jump back a number of instructions. The number is given by the contents of the addressed location. |
| 1001 | JFE | If the contents of the Accumulator is zero, jump forward a number of instructions given by the contents of the addressed location. |
| 1010 | JBE | If the contents of the Accumulator is zero, jump back a number of instructions given by the contents of the addressed location. |
| 1011 | CLR | Clear the output. |
| 1100 | OUTN | Display the contents of the Accumulator in the output as a number. |
| 1101 | OUTC | Display the contents of the Accumulator in the output as a character. |
